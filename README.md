# Google Cloud Data Engineer Certification Study Guide

## Overview

This test assesses your ability to:

	1. Design data processing systems
	2. Build and Operationalize Data Processing Systems
	3. Operationalize Machine Learning Models
	4. Ensure Solution Quality

Those categories are explained in more detail [here.](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/data-engineer/)

At a testing facility you will have 2 hours to solve 50 multiple choice questions on a computer. 
You can mark questions you are unsure about and can review them towards the end of the test. After you submit your test, 
you will see a provisional result of either PASS or FAIL. The official results will be sent to you in the next few days. If 
everything goes well you'll receive this [certification](https://www.credential.net/coxzk5me?key=acd89490bdfe162f06b1b39aac3ba74f67c8a244e5ab638e3d52cd23116071f3).
Good luck!
