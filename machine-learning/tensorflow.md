# Tensorflow

-	OS Machine learning/ Deep learning platform
-	Lazy evaluate during build, full evaluate during execution.
-	TensorFlow Estimator API
o	High level object oriented API
o	Makes it easy to build models.
o	Specifies predefined architectures, such as linear regressors or neural networks.
-	Tf.layers, tf.losses, tf.metrics
o	Reusable libraries for common model components.
-	Python TensorFlow
o	Provides Ops, which wrap C++ Kernels
-	Can run on CPU, GPU, or TPU
o	Kernels work on more than one platform.
-	Feature Engineering
o	Often means converting raw log file entries to tf.Example protocol buffers. See also tf.Transform
